# Fantasy Coach

- This project used Python to develop an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to build their own fantasy teams using player attribute analysis and statistical comparison. 
- The GUI enables users to select and compare players based on various attributes such as their performance statistics, past performance, age, and other relevant information. 
- Using these attributes, the GUI recommends suitable players for each position in the team, taking into account the user's preferred strategy and play style.
- To enhance the user experience, the project incorporated several data visualization tools such as graphs, charts, and interactive widgets. 
- These tools provide users with a visual representation of player statistics and make it easier for them to compare players and make informed decisions. 
- The GUI also allows users to save their team configurations, track their progress over time, and make adjustments as needed.
- Overall, this project provides an user-friendly platform for building winning fantasy teams using data analysis, statistical comparison, and data visualization.
